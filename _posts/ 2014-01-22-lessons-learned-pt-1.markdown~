This beautiful blog is an original, self-developed, one-of-a-kind Jekyll theme I created a while ago. The main design inspiration was design the [devcharm](http://devcharm.com) site. Even though this experiment was mostly successful(the presence of this blog being proof), I made many interesting but some-what wrong decisions. This is the first of many posts to discuss these decisions.

I intend to build a better theme at the end of this series (with the help of the lessons learned from developing [Shotgun](https://github.com/nadjetey/Shotgun)).
