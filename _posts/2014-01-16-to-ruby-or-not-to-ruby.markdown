title:  "To ruby or not to ruby?"
sub-title: The beauty in the language structure and simplicity coupled with the implicitly forced conventions, have made Ruby on Rails the developers favourite programming language. Or so it seems in my little corner?

As a web developer, should [PHP](http://www.php.net/) be your number 1 goto tool?
I sampled the views of a view developers in my circle, and the popular opinion is -
as a web dev, you should use simpler, more straight-forward and consistent programming language.
Most of these devs, believe [Ruby on Rails](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) is should be the appointed 'handy' tool.

After fighting this for a while, I finally decided to join 'em. I have resolved to learning this
new language in 7 days. I intend to start with [this](https://rubymonk.com/). Wish me luck.

#Update
First off, Ruby on rails is not a programming language, its a web framework. So it will be unfair to compare it to PHP - which is an actual language. That being said, it's about time I learned a new tool (programming language or not). 
If you still need to do some comparison, I think I would be interested in seeing how [Symfony2](http://symfony.com/) & Ruby on rails match up.
After that, the Rails vs. [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
