As a web developer, should [PHP](http://www.php.net/) be your number 1 goto tool?
I sampled the views of a view developers in my circle, and the popular opinion is -
as a web dev, you should use simpler, more straight-forward and consistent programming language.
Most of these devs, believe [Ruby on Rails](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) is should be the appointed 'handy' tool.

After fighting this for a while, I finally decided to join 'em. I have resolved to learning this
new language in 7 days. I intend to start with [this](https://rubymonk.com/). Wish me luck.
